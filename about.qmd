As a data scientist and Ph.D. candidate in sociology at Charles University with expertise in media communication, I have a strong interest in exploring how Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning can benefit my discipline and promote societal transparency and accountability. 

My recent work includes implementing automated end-to-end data pipelines for the analysis of [political communication](https://github.com/opop999/TI_monitoring_fb_political_ads_2023) and [election spending](https://github.com/opop999/TI_monitoring_transparent_accounts_2023) at Transparency International, dissertation research of 0.9 million articles on [migration in Czech media 2015-2022](https://github.com/opop999/media_discourse_research), and developing a computational research pipeline to analyze a decade of transcripts from Czech Television as part of a grant project focused on [climate change reporting](https://github.com/opop999/public_media_climate_change) at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague.

In addition to conducting research and implementing data science solutions, I enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge with others. I have contributed to public outreach efforts, including the `Radlibrary` R package, chapter in the open-source book [APIs for social scientists](https://bookdown.org/paul/apis_for_social_scientists/facebook-ad-library-api.html) and the [written language improver](https://opop999.github.io/syntax_improver_static_site/) web application.

## Research & Data Science

**Data Scientist**, Transparency International Czech Republic <br>
*May 2021 – Present*

<details btn btn-outline-light>
<summary class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-tiny">Details</summary>
  - As a Data Scientist cooperating with Transparency International, I have been responsible for implementing several automated end-to-end data pipelines for the analysis of political communication and election spending in the Czech Republic. These pipelines were crucial for several key projects, including the tracking of political actor spending on transparent bank accounts in 2021 and 2023, and the analysis of Facebook political ads for the 2021 legislative elections, the 2022 municipal and senate elections, and the 2023 presidential elections.
- My work on these projects involved extracting data using API and web scraping techniques, preprocessing and analyzing the data, and creating visualizations using a dashboard with interactive graphs. I also automated the entire process to ensure that we had access to daily updated data. This included close coordination with analysts from AMO (Association for International Affairs) and NLP engineers from Geneea.
- In addition to my work on these data pipelines, I also provided consultation on the technological feasibility and research validity of the "Hate speech on social media" project. I also authored the successfully accepted application to get access to the microtargeting dataset of political ads on Meta's platforms, which enabled us to get a more detailed view on what strategies political actors use on social media.
- Furthermore, I developed a ML classification model to help with the assessment of the transaction types on the transparent bank accounts, which is traditionally manually-intensive. Finally, as part of public outreach, I contributed to the Radlibrary package, which provides high-level access to Meta Ad Library API in R language and wrote a chapter in the open-source book "APIs for social scientists" on the usage of this package.

**Data Scientist**, Academy of Performing Arts in Prague <br>
*Jan 2022 – Present*

<details btn btn-outline-light>
<summary class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-tiny">Details</summary>
- In my role as a Data Scientist on the grant project focused on Czech Public Television and Climate Change Reporting, I was responsible for developing a computational research pipeline to analyze over 0.6 million transcripts from the Czech Television. This project aims to investigate how climate change is reported on by this public media outlet.
- As part of my responsibilities, I extracted data using the Newton Media API and performed preprocessing techniques, such as lemmatization using UDPipe for the Czech language. The primary analysis for this project involved topic modelling, which I conducted using both LDA and NMF algorithms to provide the best model as determined by area experts. To help with model assessment, I used LDAVis for interactive visualization of each of the models.
- In addition to the main analysis method, I also conducted a sentiment analysis using a pre-trained CZERT/BERT model, accelerated with GPU using Kaggle. I was also responsible for keyword extraction using TF-IDF and KeyBERT from the lemmatized corpus, as well as named entity recognition using a NameTag model.

<summary class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-tiny">Details</summary>
- During my research stay at the University of Vienna's Department of Communication, I made significant progress in my research on the media communication of migration in the Czech Republic. Working closely with my collaborator, Irene Elmerot, a linguist from Stockholm University, we accessed the Newton Media API and extracted over 800,000 media articles related to migration between 2015 and the present. We then cleaned the data using Regex and conducted lemmatization, Part-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition, and sentiment analysis on the entire corpus.
- We also prepared for several planned analyses using R and Python, including word embeddings, word collocations, topic modeling, and keyword extraction. In addition to these efforts, I was also involved in collecting and preparing various contextual datasets for further analysis, including political ads on Facebook and Google, tweets from top Czech media outlets, parliamentary speeches, and disinformation narratives. I also gained access to CrowdTangle's research platform and downloaded data on Google Trends and Wikipedia to measure the salience of migration in the Czech Republic.
- My stay was significantly aided by the academic supervision of Jörg Matthes and the opportunity to participate in the events of the AdMe research group and, especially, the Computational Communication Lab, where we presented our preliminary findings. Overall, my research stay under the "Aktion Österreich-Tschechien" grant at the University of Vienna allowed me to make significant progress in my Ph.D. research and enhance my knowledge and skills in natural language processing and computational communication research.
