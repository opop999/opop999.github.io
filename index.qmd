<span class=dropcap>I</span> am a sociologist at the Charles University with a focus on political communication, recently finished my research stay at the Deparment of Communication at the University of Vienna. <br><br> I am interested in how computational tools, such as Natural Language Processing, could benefit social science in particular, and, more generally, the development of a healthy democratic society at large. <br><br> Besides conducting research and implementing data science solutions, I am passionate about teaching, language learning and knowledge sharing.
